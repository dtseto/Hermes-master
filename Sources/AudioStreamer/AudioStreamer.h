/**
 * This class is implemented on top of Apple's AudioQueue framework. This
 * framework is much too low-level for must use cases, so this class
 * encapsulates the functionality to provide a nicer interface. The interface
 * still requires some management, but it is far more sane than dealing with the
 * AudioQueue structures yourself.
 *
 * This class is essentially a pipeline of three components to get audio to the
 * speakers:
 *
 *              NSURLSession => AudioFileStream => AudioQueue
 *
 * ### NSURLSession
 *
 * The method of reading HTTP data is using NSURLSession which provides modern
 * networking capabilities including background transfers, configuration, and
 * delegate callbacks. All data read from the HTTP stream is piped into the
 * AudioFileStream which then parses all of the data. This stage of the pipeline
 * also flags that events are happening to prevent a timeout. All network
 * activity occurs on a background thread managed by NSURLSession.
 *
 * ### AudioFileStream
 *
 * This stage is implemented by Apple frameworks, and parses all audio data.
 * It is composed of two callbacks which receive data. The first callback invoked
 * in series is one which is notified whenever a new property is known about the
 * audio stream being received. Once all properties have been read, the second
 * callback beings to be invoked, and this callback is responsible for dealing
 * with packets.
 *
 * The second callback is invoked whenever complete "audio packets" are
 * available to send to the audio queue. This stage is invoked on the call stack
 * of the stream which received the data (synchronously with receiving the
 * data).
 *
 * Packets received are buffered in a static set of buffers allocated by the
 * audio queue instance. When a buffer is full, it is committed to the audio
 * queue, and then the next buffer is moved on to. Multiple packets can possibly
 * fit in one buffer. When committing a buffer, if there are no more buffers
 * available, then the data fetch is suspended and all currently received data
 * is stored aside for later processing.
 *
 * ### AudioQueue
 *
 * This final stage is also implemented by Apple, and receives all of the full
 * buffers of data from the AudioFileStream's parsed packets. The implementation
 * manages its own set of threads, but callbacks are invoked on the main thread.
 * The two callbacks that the audio stream is interested in are playback state
 * changing and audio buffers being freed.
 *
 * When a buffer is freed, then it is marked as so, and if the stream was
 * waiting for a buffer to be freed a message to empty the queue as much as
 * possible is sent to the main thread's run loop. Otherwise no extra action
 * need be performed.
 *
 * The main purpose of knowing when the playback state changes is to change the
 * state of the player accordingly.
